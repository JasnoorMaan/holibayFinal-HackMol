# holibay
Traveling to a strange city might be stressful. One does not always know all the famous or underrated spots Do you also face these problems?

1)Are you fed up of too many opinions of people around on street or be it your hotel manager when you ask what are the
tourist attractions here?

2)what is best to eat and in which part of the town?

3) Some unknown worthwhile places are always left unvisited while on vacation.


Say no more, holibay is a hybrid between travel magazine with all the information you need while in town and reservation giants such as OYO, Club Mahindra and Airbnb. While planning your vacation one can book the hotels, make reservations at a restaurant and know all the famous street names and local dishes to try. Visiting tourist spots are planned in such a way you will not miss any during your visit. It does make your travel easier.

It's basically like an Instagram page of a city showing a wholesome picture of a destination with a provision of making reservations and bookings like any normal app on the spot.

It's better than a magazine which carries information about the nook and corners of the city which the giants like OYO and ClubMahindra simply lack. They are just reservation mediators whereas holibay connects to the roots of the city and acts as a catalog.

__holibay__ provides  __profile__ and __Portfolio__ of the places to the tourists giving the general information regarding


* __The best hotels__ 

* The best __places__ to visit 

* The Most __popular food__ of the place 

* __Special events__  and many more useful information
   to the travellers about the location.

 One stop place for the travellers
So now the __travellers donâ€™t have to ask others__ what to do where to go what is the must try food and must visit sites __.__
